	<p class = "bioText" style = "float:left"> I studied music for years at the university of Idaho and while studying music education I discovered a fascination with the development of video games and how music plays a part in the gaming experience. This eventually led me to the GIMM program at BSU where I am currently studying game development and design. I am a nerd through and though and spend most of my free time either playing video games or playing dungeons and dragons. I was a founding member of the Dungeons and Broncos club at BSU and enjoy bringing a game I love so much to so many different people.

	<p class = "skillsText"> I am a classically trained musician and composer. I have taught elementary music and private lessons. I have a basic understanding of a couple coding languages, C# and Action Script. I am an accomplished dungeon master and have taught many people to play many differing tabletop roll playing games.</p>
